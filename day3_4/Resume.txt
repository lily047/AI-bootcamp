Dry Plastic Waste Detection & Segregation System  
Embedded Systems  
• Developed a sensor -based prototype  to detect and segregate dry plastic waste using IR 
sensor readings  and threshold -based classification.  
• Calibrated IR sensor values through experimentation and defined a baseline to distinguish 
plastic vs non -plastic  materials.  
• Implemented embedded C++ logic on Arduino Uno  to process sensor input, control a servo 
motor , and display real -time system status via the serial console.  
• Integrated a proximity -based sensor to monitor dustbin fill levels  and detect overflow conditions.  
• Demonstrated skills in testing, validation, and hardware –software integration  under 
constrained embedded environments.  
Technologies:  Arduino Uno, IR Sensor, Proximity/UV Sensor, Servo Motor, C++ (Embedded)
