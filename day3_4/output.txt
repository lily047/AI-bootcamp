1] You want to join a secret club, and you are told that you need to go to a specific place at
midnight and say the password "ChennaiSuperKings". Which of the following is true about this
setup? [MSQ: 3 points]
1. It is role based access control
2. It is attribute based access control
3. It is discretionary access control
4. It is mandatory access control
Answer: Option 2 and 3.
Solution: Not role based because there is no role associated with the access, and not mandatory
because you can give the password and information to someone else.
2] Which of the following are good characteristics of a function that can be used for digest
authentication (assume that in y=f(x) , computing y given x is the forward computation and
getting back x given y is the inverse computation)? [MCQ: 2 points]
1. It should be easy to compute in the forward direction, but difficult to compute the inverse.
2. It should be easy to compute the inverse, but not the forward function.
3. Both forward and inverse functions should be easy to compute.
4. Both forward and inverse functions should be difficult to compute.
Answer: Option 1.
Solution: Option 2 is not correct - if the forward is also difficult, then using the function itself will
be impossible. Other two options are clearly wrong.
3] In a Flask application, which of the following would typically be the place where you apply
access control directives? [MCQ: 1 point]
1. Model
2. View
3. Controller
4. All of the above
Answer: Option 3.
Solution: Views and Models cannot be accessed directly in any case, only through appropriate
controllers.
4] HT TPS certificates are associated with _. [MCQ: 1 point]
1. A domain name
2. An individual person
3. An IP address
4. A company
Answer: Option 1.

certificate is associated with the company itself, only with the domain name.
5] In the picture shown below, there are some log entries corresponding to a Flask application.
Which of the following data are being logged by this application? [MSQ: 3 points]
Image..
1. IP address of the client
2. Type of HT TP request
3. Operating system of the client
4. Browser used by the client
Answer: Option 1 and 2.
Solution: Others are not being logged here.
6] Log files tend to be: [MCQ: 2 points]
1. Mostly read operations and few write operations.
2. Mostly write operations and few read operations.
3. Proportional in size to the number of requests the website receives.
4. Constant in size independent of server load.
Answer: Option 2.
Solution: Log files are mostly write operations and few read operations. It may be possible to
have contant log files under some specific logging scenarios, but that is not typical usage.
7] Consider two statements on HT TPS given below: [MCQ: 2 points]
Statement 1: HT TPS reduces load on servers as less information needs to be transmitted.  
Statement 2: HT TPS is only used for humans to interact with web servers, and is not required for
machine-to-machine communication.
1. Both statement 1 and statement 2 are correct.
2. Both statement 1 and statement 2 are incorrect.
3. Statement 1 is correct, statement 2 is incorrect.
4. Statement 2 is correct, statement 1 is incorrect.
Answer: Option 2.
Solution: Generally after encryption the size of data and headers would increase a bit, not
decrease. HT TPS is just as essential for machine-to-machine communication to avoid leaking
information.
